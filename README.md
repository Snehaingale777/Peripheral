# Peripheral
A peripheral in the context of microcontrollers (like the STM32F407) refers to hardware modules or subsystems that provide additional functionalities beyond the basic operation of the central processing unit (CPU). These peripherals are integrated into the microcontroller to perform specific tasks and can be accessed through memory-mapped registers.

Common Peripherals in Microcontrollers:
1.UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter): For serial communication.
2.SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface): For high-speed communication with other devices like sensors or memory.
3.I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit): For communication with peripherals like EEPROMs, sensors, etc.
4.GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output): Used to control input/output pins.
